= Customizing Typus

You can overwrite and extend Admin::MasterController with your methods.

Actions have to be defined in <tt>config/typus/application.yml</tt>:

    Post:
      actions:
        index: custom_action
        edit: custom_action_for_an_item

And you have to add permissions on <tt>config/typus/application_roles.yml</tt> 
to have access to them.

    admin:
      Post: create, read, update, destroy, custom_action

    editor:
      Post: create, read, update, custom_action_for_an_item

And your controller should look like this ...

    class Admin::PostsController < MasterController

      def index
      end

      def custom_action
      end

      def custom_action_for_an_item
      end

    end

# TODO: Instructions on the tableless resources.

# This controller was generated because you have defined a resource 
# on <tt>config/typus/XXXXXX_roles.yml</tt> which is a tableless model.
#
#     admin:
#       <%= resource %>: index
#
