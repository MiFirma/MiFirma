== 2.5.0

* Works better with Rails 3
* Bugfix: schema kept prepending additional newlines
* Updates to make annotate smarter about when to touch a model
* Recognize column+type, and don't change a file unless the column+type combination of the new schema are different than that of the old (i.e., don't regenerate if columns happen to be in a different order. That's just how life is sometimes.)
* Grab old specification even if it has \r\n as line endings rather than pure \ns
* Various warning and specification fixes
* Fix "no such file to load -- annotate/annotate_models (MissingSourceFile)" error (require statements in tasks now use full path to lib files)
* warn about macros, to mitigate when we're included during a production run, not just a rakefile run -- possibly at the expense of too much noise
* Adding rake as a runtime dependency
* If the schema is already in the model file, it will be replaced into the same location.  If it didn't previously exist, it'll be placed according to the "position", as before.
* Allow task loading from Rakefile for gems (plugin installation already auto-detects).
* Add skip_on_db_migrate option as well for people that don't want it
* Fix options parsing to convert strings to proper booleans
* Add support for Fabrication fabricators
* Leave magic encoding comment intact
* Fix issue #14 - RuntimeError: Already memoized
* Count a model as 'annotated' if any of its tests/fixtures are annotated
* Support :change migrations (Rails 3.1)
* Allow models with non-standard capitalization
* Widen type column so we can handle longtexts with chopping things off.
* Skip trying to get list of models from commandline when running via Rake (was
  preventing the use of multiple rake tasks in one command if one of them was
  db:migrate).
* Add ability to skip annotations for a model by adding
  '# -*- SkipSchemaAnnotations' anywhere in the file.
* Don't show column limits for integer and boolean types.
* Add sorting for columns and indexes. (Helpful for out-of-order migration
  execution, but use --no-sort if you don't want this.)
* Annotate unit tests in subfolders.
* Add generator to install rakefile that automatically annotates on db:migrate.
* Correct Gemfile to clarify which environments need which gems.
* Add an .rvmrc to facilitate clean development.
* Refactor out ActiveRecord monkey-patch to permit extending without
  side-effects.
* Use ObjectSpace to locate models to facilitate handling of models with
  non-standard capitalization.
  Note that this still requires that the inflector be configured to understand
  the special case.
* Merge against many of the older branches on Github whose functionality is
  already reflected to reduce confusion about what is and is not implemented
  here.
* Accept String or Symbol for :position (et al) options.
* Add RDoc output formatting as an option.
* Add Markdown output formatting as an option.
* Add option to force annotation regeneration.
* Add new configuration option for controlling where info is placed in
  fixtures/factories.
* Fix for models without tables.
* Fix gemspec generation now that Jeweler looks at Gemfile.
* Fix warning: `NOTE: Gem::Specification#default_executable= is deprecated with
  no replacement. It will be removed on or after 2011-10-01.`
* Fix handling of files with no trailing newline when putting annotations at
  the end of the file.
* Now works on tables with no primary key.
* --format=markdown option
* --trace option to help debug "Unable to annotate" errors
* "Table name" annotation (if table name is different from model name)
* "Human name" annotation (enabling translation to non-English locales)
* Fix JRuby ObjectSpace compatibility bug (https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models/pull/85)
* Fix FactoryGirl compatibility bug (https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models/pull/82)

  * these options can be specified from command line as -d and -p [before|after]
